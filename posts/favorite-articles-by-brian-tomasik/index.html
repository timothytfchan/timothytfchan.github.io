If you’re thinking about reading his work, this list could be a good place to start. Note that this is based on what I personally find interesting; it is not a definitive guide. These are listed in no particular order.\nDissolving Confusion about Consciousness Consciousness is a “cluster in thingspace” comprising physical systems that we consider to be similar in some way. It is a label for systems, not an essence within systems. Also, like defining “tables”, defining “consciousness” may be similarly arbitrary and fuzzy.\nThe Eliminativist Approach to Consciousness Instead of thinking in terms of “conscious” and “unconscious” we should directly focus on how physical systems work. Aspects of systems are not merely indicators of pain, but are part of the cluster of things that we call “pain” (attribute the label “pain”). Tomasik also draws parallels between eliminativism and panpsychism and highlights that there is a shared implication of both theories that there is no clear separation of consciousness with physical reality, which may further suggest that we should put more weight to ideas that less complex systems can suffer.\nHow to Interpret a Physical System as a Mind Uses the concept of a “sentience classifier” to describe how we might interpret physical systems as minds. Distinct theories offer different approaches to building the classifier. Classification then involves “identifying the traits of the physical system in question” (taking in the data and searching for relevant features) as a first step and “mapping from those traits to high-level emotions and valences” (labeling the data) as a second step. Our brains might already be vaguely implementing the sentience classifier - albeit with more messiness, complexity, and components and processes particular to the brain.\nThe Many Fallacies of Dualism This article touches on a common theme underlying Tomasik’s approach to topics like consciousness, free will, moral (anti)realism, and mathematical (anti)realism: rejecting dualism in favor of a simpler physicalist monism.\nThe Importance of Wild Animal Suffering A good introduction to the topic. Discusses the extensive suffering experienced by wild animals due to natural causes like disease, predation, and environmental hardships, which may outweigh moments of happiness. Vast numbers and short, brutal lives of wild animals make their suffering a significant ethical issue.\nWhy Vegans Should Care about Suffering in Nature A shorter introduction to the topic.\nThe Horror of Suffering A vivid reflection on the horror of suffering. Suffering is not merely an abstract concept but a dire reality that demands urgent moral attention. There is a long history of intuitions that prioritize the reduction of suffering.\nOne Trillion Fish Short piece on the direct harms caused by large-scale fishing (though note that when taking into account population changes and wild-animal suffering, the sign of this is less clear). Suggests humane slaughter of fish as an intervention that side-steps the uncertainty of net impact of fishing on wild-animal suffering.\nHow Does Vegetarianism Impact Wild-Animal Suffering? Note that there are likely more comprehensive analyses now. That animal suffering is increased in some ways because of a vegetarian/vegan diet is counterintuitive but important to recognize. You might still want to be vegetarian/vegan and not eat meat as it might help with becoming more motivated to reduce suffering.\nHow Rainforest Beef Production Affects Wild-Animal Suffering Creating cattle pastures prevents the suffering of counterfactual rainforest animals (in particular invertebrates).\nHabitat Loss, Not Preservation, Generally Reduces Wild-Animal Suffering Reducing plant growth/net primary productivity reduces wild-animal suffering - challenging the inclusion of environmentalism in the animal welfare/rights \u0026 vegan/vegetarianism memeplexes.\nIs There Suffering in Fundamental Physics? Many theories of consciousness imply some weight on the possibility of suffering in fundamental physics. This especially follows from eliminativism, and of course, theories of consciousness that are explicitly panpsychist. The numerosity of fundamental physical operations may present a wager.\nWhy Your Laptop May Be Marginally Sentient Similar article. Laptops too.\nBacteria, Plants, and Graded Sentience Another similar article that considers the possibility of suffering in systems that are not intuitively capable of suffering. Personally, suffering in microorganisms feels more real than suffering in physics (I suspect feeling might be all we have to go by and we might not have a better solution to understand consciousness).\nFuzzy, Nested Minds Problematize Utilitarian Aggregation Different ways of counting physical systems as individual minds results in very different numbers and some complications. I possibly-seriously, possibly-jokingly think this implies a moral wager on systems ~half the size of a finite, discrete universe, in such a universe (the most numerous class of systems according to a “sum over all systems” approach).\nHow the Simulation Argument Dampens Future Fanaticism I think this is an original argument of Tomasik’s. This looks at how having simulated copies of yourself changes the relative expected value of long-term vs. near-term interventions. Essentially, as Tomasik puts it, if “there’s a non-trivial chance that most of the copies of ourselves are instantiated in relatively short-lived simulations run by superintelligent civilizations … when we act to help others in the short run, our good deeds are duplicated many times over.” The gap in the order of magnitude (OOMs) of expected value between long-term and near-term interventions is narrowed but still significant.\nStrategic Considerations for Moral Antinatalists Antinatalists who are morally-motivated may want to shift focus towards opportunities that have a larger impact on suffering reduction.\nOmelas and Space Colonization A good short piece tempering excessive optimism about the value of the future. I like it because it acknowledges the existence of those who may be suffering in the far future.\nTwo-Envelopes Problem for Uncertainty about Brain-Size Valuation and Other Moral Questions An introduction to a problem with making comparisons between the dis(value) of experiences in small and large brains. I’m still often confused about this.\nAstronomical suffering from slightly misaligned artificial intelligence Mentions the risk of SignFlip, where an AI maximizes the opposite of its intended utility function. It’s already happened before with GPT-2.\nWhy Charities Usually Don’t Differ Astronomically in Expected Cost-Effectiveness Pushback against the claims that some charities are \u003e 10^10 times as cost-effective as other charities, which seems to be a common meme in the earlier days of EA.\nWhy Honesty is a Good Policy Dishonesty is generally a bad idea. We should reduce naive utilitarian tendencies.\nEducation Matters for Altruism Learning often isn’t suboptimal. Many of us are probably focused on interventions that we would consider suboptimal or even harmful on reflection simply because we currently don’t know enough about how the world works.\nDoes the Against Malaria Foundation Reduce Invertebrate Suffering? I think this might be dated because of malaria vaccines? AMF could also reduce large amounts of invertebrate suffering (more humans, more resources used, fewer invertebrates, less invertebrate suffering).\nHow Many Wild Animals Are There? Useful estimates. But likely superseded by other studies that have also made estimates.\n",

<p>Brian Tomasik has written a lot of <a href="https://reducing-suffering.org/">essays on reducing suffering</a>. In this post, I&rsquo;ve picked out my favorites. If you&rsquo;re thinking about reading his work, this list could be a good place to start. Note that this is based on what I personally find interesting; it is not a definitive guide.

<p>Consciousness is a “cluster in thingspace” comprising physical systems that we consider to be similar in some way. It is a label for systems, not an essence within systems. Also, like defining “tables”, defining “consciousness” may be similarly arbitrary and fuzzy.</p>

<p>Another similar article that considers the possibility of suffering in systems that are not intuitively capable of suffering. Personally, suffering in microorganisms <em>feels</em> more real than suffering in physics (I suspect <a href="https://timothytfchan.github.io/posts/common-sense-sentience-is-dubious/">feeling might be all we have to go by</a> and we might not have a better solution to understand consciousness).</p>

<p>Different ways of counting physical systems as individual minds results in very different numbers and some complications. I possibly-seriously, possibly-jokingly think this implies a moral wager on systems ~half the size of a finite, discrete universe, in such a universe (the most numerous class of systems according to a “sum over all systems” approach).</p>

<p>I think this is an original argument of Tomasik’s. This looks at how having simulated copies of yourself changes the relative expected value of long-term vs. near-term interventions. Essentially, as Tomasik puts it, if “there&rsquo;s a non-trivial chance that most of the copies of ourselves are instantiated in relatively short-lived simulations run by superintelligent civilizations … when we act to help others in the short run, our good deeds are duplicated many times over.” The gap in the order of magnitude (OOMs) of expected value between long-term and near-term interventions is narrowed but still significant.</p>

<p>Antinatalists who are morally-motivated may want to shift focus towards opportunities that have a larger impact on suffering reduction.</p>

<p>A good short piece tempering excessive optimism about the value of the future. I like it because it acknowledges the existence of those who may be suffering in the far future.</p>

<p>Learning often isn’t suboptimal. Many of us are probably focused on interventions that we would consider suboptimal or even harmful on reflection simply because we currently don’t know enough about how the world works.</p>

<p>I think this might be dated because of malaria vaccines? AMF could also reduce large amounts of invertebrate suffering (more humans, more resources used, fewer invertebrates, less invertebrate suffering).</p>

<p>Useful estimates. But likely superseded by other studies that have also made estimates.</p>
